- create variables int,unit, int8-int64 and uint8-uint64, rune, byte ,float32,float64,any 

- assign numbers to respective variables 

- calculate sum of all numbers and put in a variable called float64 

- var sum float64 = num1 +num2 .... (but num1 is int , num2 is uint, num3 is int8 and so on..)
